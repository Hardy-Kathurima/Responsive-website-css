    <!--main content-->
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Over the recent past decades the war on drugs has been of great concern all over the world. Various strategies
        have been used to prevent drug abuse. Among the methods deployed is deontology. By description, <a
          href="https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-deontology/" target="_blank">deontology </a>is an ethical theory
        that
        uses rules to distinguish right from wrong. The theory was developed by a philosopher <a
          href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/" target="_blank">Emmanuel Kant</a> (Churchland, 2018). </p>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Kant argued that by using the authority of reason, one is able to judge right from wrong. According to the book
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwork_of_the_Metaphysic_of_Morals" target="_blank">“Groundwork of
          The Metaphysics of
          Morals” </a> one should behave in a manner in which is appropriate even when being conducted by
        someone else. It further implies that you should treat others the way you would want them to treat you. With
        this in mind it is essential for people making drug policies to put into consideration the rights of the drug
        users. People should
        not be forced to follow certain specified rules but rather have the ability to make their own decision when it
        comes to drug use (Rothbard, 2002). </p>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Using deontology approach in drug war requires people to be educated on various drugs,their implications and
        how to use them and . This will help people to move away from the idea that all drugs are harmful. <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug" target="_blank">Drugs</a> are any substances which
        when taken can affect how we react to certain situations and mood. For instance <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_coffee" target="_blank">coffee is a very famous drug</a> that
        has been in use since 13th century. It has a
        calming effect and helps us relate well with others.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In the near future we should have specialists who will conduct tests on us and help us determine appropriate
        drugs for us and in what dosage we should take them. This will make us better drug takers and ensure we use
        drugs for productivity
        rather than doing harm to others. When this is accomplished, we will have won the drug war and once more
        deontology will prove to be one of the best ever formulated theories to solve ethical problems such as <a
          href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Drug-Abuse.aspx">drug abuse</a> .(Kymlicka, 2002).</p>
